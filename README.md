# "Your Diary" 
I have created an app - "Your Diary" - to keep your notes secure on the cloud.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* Node.js
* React.js
* JavaScript 
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Basic details
- Created the backend of the app using Node.js and connected to the MongoDB server to store the user data securely on the cloud. 
- Added pepper and salt to provide additional security to the user password even if the database gets hacked. 
- Created the front end of the app using React.js, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. 
- Used several React.js Hooks such as "useState", "useContext" that makes our app more efficient. 
- Implemented features of the react-router-dom that helps to access the various pages of the app without reloading, thus effectively making it a single page application.


## Special Features
- Users can login to their accounts and view, add a new note as well as edit and delete the existing notes
- Shows promt alerts to the user on various actions 
- The user data is safe on the MongoDB cloud

## To run the app: type "npm run both" in the terminal 
(running the backend and front end together using concurrently package)
